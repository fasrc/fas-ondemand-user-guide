# A brief tour of FAS OnDemand

When you first launch FAS OnDemand from your Canvas course, you will land on a dashboard that looks something like this:

1. **Interactive Apps**: Lists the interactive applications that are setup for your class. To start an app, simply click on the icon and follow the prompts to start a new *interactive session*. Note that you can always access the list of apps from the top navigation bar as well.
2. **Tools**: Additional tools that are specific to FAS OnDemand to help you manage files, jobs, etc. These are all optional tools. It's possible to do everything you need within the application itself.
    - **Home Directory**: Your home directory will be mounted automatically by the interactive apps, so any changes you make in the app will be available here, and vice versa. In some cases, it is more convenient to upload/download large files using this tool.
    - **Job Composer** (advanced): For submitting batch jobs. Most users will not need this.
    - **Active Jobs**  (advanced): For managing compute jobs. Most users will not need this.
    - **Shell Access**: Your home directory files and configuration can be managed via the command line using this tool. 
3. **My Interactive Sessions**: Lists running applications. Use this to re-connect to an application that was previously started or to stop an application.
4. **Help**: List of resources to get help.
