# FAS OnDemand

FAS OnDemand was a service offered by HUIT Academic Technology and FAS Research Computing. It provided courses with access to FASRC compute resources in the Academic Cluster, maintained by FAS Research Computing.

The Academic Cluster has been decommissioned, so this platform is no longer available. For information on alternative platforms available to courses, visit [atg.fas.harvard.edu/academic-computing](https://atg.fas.harvard.edu/academic-computing).
