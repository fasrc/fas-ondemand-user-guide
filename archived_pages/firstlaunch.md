# First time launching OnDemand

When you launch OnDemand for the first time in a course, even if you've used the platform before in a different course, the system has to set up a new account for you. It's best to make sure that your account is created before you intend to use OnDemand, since it can take some time for new accounts to be fully operational and it is possible for you to encounter errors accessing OnDemand apps until that process is complete. 

After clicking the link to launch the tool in your Canvas site, you'll see a screen with a message that says "Building Your User Account...", like this:

After a short delay, the status will change to "Complete", like this:

![Screenshot of text that reads: Building Your User Account... Status: Complete. You will shortly be redirected to your dashboard. When your account is built you will be forwarded to the dashboard. This normally takes about 30 seconds.](images/first-launch-2.png)

That will redirect you to the OnDemand homepage when your account has been successfully created. You will likely have a different selection of apps, but the home screen will look like this:
